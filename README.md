# Logan. Personal english teacher.

## Why he is so special?
### tl;dr

### In more detail

Thanks to logan learning english never been easier. After choosing interest, language goal and adding some personal data (beacuse learning will be funnier) you will have access to the best teacher.
Logan is designed to speak about the most interesting topics that you like. 
You can:
Learn new words, idioms, and grammar structures. 
Do the homework given to you and check it together.
Do quizzes after each lesson.
.. and much much more.

### Reflect functionallity
Logan is capable of learning how you learn. This is based on the concept of reflection. After each lesson (which is a series of messages), the teacher creates a summary, draws conclusions, and makes improvements for future lessons.
For example, if I propose mnemonics for learning new words because that will be easier to learn, the next lesson will fully utilize mnemonics.

Here is an example conclusion:
```
Today's lesson with Bob focused on advanced AI vocabulary, grammar, and idioms. We discussed the meaning and usage of several vocabulary words, including grief, lightheartedness, juvenile, stifle, and anoint. Bob had some difficulties initially, but after providing additional examples and mnemonics, he seemed to grasp the concepts better.

We also covered the idiom "let the cat out of the bag" and explored its similarity to "spill the beans." Furthermore, we discussed advanced AI concepts such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and their potential impact on the future. Bob demonstrated a good understanding of these concepts and was able to use the advanced AI vocabulary in sentences.

Towards the end, we briefly discussed potential updates for Bob's MemeMatch app and wrapped up with a quick quiz on the AI vocabulary we learned. Overall, Bob made progress in today's session, but there is still room for improvement, especially in using new vocabulary in context.

In future sessions, we could consider incorporating more interactive activities, such as role-plays or debates, to help Bob practice using new vocabulary and idioms in real-life situations. Additionally, offering more examples and mnemonics could help him better understand and remember challenging words.

## Technology stack
- Python (backend, API)
- LangChain (gpt-3.5-turbo) and (gpt-4) for reflection
- Firebase (authorization and firestore)
- Make (scheduled events like teaching plan creation)
- Airtable
- Shortcuts
- Eleven Labs

## Origin version

The best version is mine, private. That's obvious. But why is that?

On my Mac, I've prepared shortcuts:

- Word English learner
- Idiom learner

These are connected with Make and Airtable. For example, if I'm watching a series and I don't know some words, I can easily type them into the input using a simple keyboard shortcut. That's also possible directly from my iPhone.

Learing with him makes more fun. Cheers
